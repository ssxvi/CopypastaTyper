# CopypastaTyper

---
This program will retype an inputted block of text as if you typed it with your keyboard at the push of a button! 
The program will automatically segment messages to an exact character maximum so long messages will automatically be split into smaller, sendable messages.
The project heavily utilized the pynput library to recieve and output keypresses. The interface was built using TKinter.

The main motivation for this project was to paste messages in games which don't allow for regualar ctrl-v copy/paste. Since Pynput can type out messages seemingly from a keyboard, we can bypass such restrictions and paste as many messages as we want!
I also really wanted to explore differences between JFrame, HTML+CSS, and Tkinter and other Python UI Libraries. A short basic program was perfect for derusting some basic python fundamentals and testing out libraries.
